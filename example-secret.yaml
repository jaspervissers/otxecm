# OpenText Content Server Kubernetes Secrets
########################################################################

## This is a sample secrets file that could be used if you are creating your own kubernetes secret.
## You need to uncomment and populate password values for any components you are using. For example,
## if you are not using otac (Archive Server) for storage, then you can ignore those passwords.
## Provided values must be base64 encoded, per kubernetes requirements. If you are encoding in Linux
## with the base64 command, make sure you do not include new line characters. For example:
## echo -n 'aBigLongStringToEncode' | base64 -w 0
